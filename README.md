# Cloud-Based-Headless-Kali-Linux-Terminal
Portable Pentesting Toolkit

## Introduction
This project involves setting up a headless Kali Linux terminal on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) to enhance remote penetration testing capabilities. It demonstrates advanced Linux administration, virtualization, and thorough security practices. This project began as way to alleviate the need to reconfigure a virtual machine prior to an ethical hacking competition. While VMs work well, it seems that utilizing a virtual private server yields superior results. Persistence and consistence are invaluable traits in technology, and this project allows for me to continue my work seamlessly without managing multiple virtual machines on separate devices. 

If you've ever used a virtual machine, you may have heard your computer's fans begin to sound like a 747 engine. So, if you're like me and would prefer to prolong the life of your devices, it pays to reduce the strain on your local machine's RAM and CPU during cyber challenges. Utilizing exterior hardware through a secure shell remote connection is not only faster, but also more responsive than the host dependent virtual machine.
