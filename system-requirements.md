# System Requirements

In Virtual Box, it is important to store the virtual disk as a single file that is dynamically allocated. The CPU and RAM can be left at the default values as only the disk file will be uploaded into the cloud provider. Therefore, the cost of the rented cloud space for custom images is directly influenced by the size of the disk file. We will begin the build with a 20 GB image, even though it can be expanded based on the selected server plan.
